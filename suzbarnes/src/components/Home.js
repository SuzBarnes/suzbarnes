        I am a dentist turned developer and after a 6 month part time bootcamp
        with <a href="https://www.commandshift.co/">Command Shift</a> (MCR
        codes) I am breaking into the software developer world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please have a read of my blog to learn more about me and my journey into
        tech. It was the hardest 6 months of my life, but (I am hoping) well
        worth it.
