      <h2>From pulling teeth, to writing script(s)</h2>
      <p>
        It's official, I am leaving the world of dentistry for software
        development by joining the BJSS Academy in March 2023 as an Academy
        Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision wasn't easy, and for people who don't know all the ins and
        outs of being a dentist, it seems like madness. Truth be told, I have
        thought about leaving for some time. I just didn't know what I would be
        able to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        What transferable skills are there? Why would anyone employ me? I've
        spent a combination of 12 years working and studying as a dentist and am
        I really going to throw it all away?
      </p>
      <p>
        These are all common questions that I know many dentists have asked
        themselves. Not to mention the sunk-cost fallacy and starting out with a
        lower salary than they are currently on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always loved working with computers, fixing the home computer,
        debugging it and playing endless hours of computer games. I don't feel
        like software development was an option back when I was choosing my
        GCSEs or A-levels a very long time ago. I had grown up seeing dentistry
        as a viable option, my mum (who was also in dentistry) could work part
        time, I liked sciences and helping people.
      </p>

        COVID-19 happened, I had my daughter and, while on maternity leave I saw

        by Beth Collins in the Alternative Careers for Dentists/Dental Care
        Professionals Facebook group about switching to Software Development.
      </p>

      <p>I researched more and more into the career.</p>
      <p>
        I spoke to my school friend who made the switch after self learning
        while on furlough - she was really enjoying it and she pointed me to the

        </a>{" "}
        by Jen Openshaw - a full time mum embarking on a part-time bootcamp with
        Manchester Codes. She encouraged me to do a bit of freecodecamp to see
        if I enjoyed it.
      </p>
      <p className="center">I did.</p>
      <p>Pieces of the puzzle seemed to slot into place.</p>
      <p>
        All the barriers to stop me trying this were dissolving. The push out of
        dentistry and pull into a new career, particularly software development,
        were stronger than ever.
      </p>
      <p>If I didn't make this leap now...when would, when could I?</p>
      <p>
        I got in touch with the lovely Alice at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.commandshift.co/">Command Shift</a> (formally MCR
        codes) for the 6 month part time bootcamp. It would be live 3-hour
        letures online 18.30-21.30 twice a week, with dedicated Saturday help
        sessions, along with a track (which is basically homework alongside the
        course). They recommend you allocate 20 hours to self studying.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a 12 month old, I went back to work 2 days a week at a very
        friendly and well put together dental practice and enrolled.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say it was an intense 6-months was putting it mildly, however I was
        able to have my cake and eat it. I could see what dentistry was like on
        my return post-COVID and post-baby, see my daughter growing by the day
        and I could put all hours of the remaining time I had towards a new
        career path.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was difficult working knowing that one day I would leave, and not
        telling any colleagues for fear I would brush my doubts and dreams under
        the carpet as they are honestly such a caring, committed and hard
        working team
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoyed the course so so much, particularly the final group project
        where I worked with the extremely talented Lisa and Alex. We got to
        learn so much together and have a snapshot at what pair programming
        would be like, following agile methods and allsorts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was especially taken aback by how much everyone supported, helped and
        looked out for eachother, something that did take some adjusting to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the year I was fortunate, I have a strong relationship with
        my husband who has supported me in everything since we met. I believe it
        is as hard for the spouse as it is for the career-switcher. You
        essentially have another child overnight, priorities became:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Baby</li>
        <li>2. Coding</li>
        <li>3. Dog</li>
        <li>4. Husband</li>
      </ol>
      <div className="right">(Don't worry, my husband prioritied the dog.)</div>

      <p>
        I have my family and friends who kept encouraging me when I was asking
        myself "what am I doing?".
      </p>
      <p>Truth be told, I'm still asking myself that question.</p>
      <p className="center">Only now, I know.</p>
      <p>I am on the long, windy road to the rest of my life.</p>
    </div>
